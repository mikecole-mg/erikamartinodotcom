			<h2>VicHealth Postdoctoral Research Fellow, The University of Melbourne</h2>

			<p>
				Welcome to the online home of <strong>Dr Erika Martino</strong>, a VicHealth Postdoctoral
				Research Fellow at the University of Melbourne. Erika's work sits at the intersection of
				health, housing and social equity, with a focus on how research can support fairer and
				healthier communities.
			</p>

			<p>
				This site will bring together Erika's academic publications, collaborative projects, writing
				for broader audiences and work in progress. Over time, it will become a hub for sharing ideas,
				research updates and resources for policymakers, practitioners, community partners and fellow
				researchers.
			</p>

			<p>
				The rest of the site is currently under development, including dedicated pages for publications,
				research projects and news. New content will be added soon. In the meantime, please feel free
				to bookmark this page and check back for updates.
